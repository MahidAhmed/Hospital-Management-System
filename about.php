		PDCL started in a little vicinity. From then we never looked back but remember. We had started with a Colorimeter, a Hot Air Oven, Microscope, Centrifuge,
		X-Ray Machine, ECG, Ultrasonogram Machine and a typewriter. In early 1988 we have introduced Computer in our Centre, which was first in the private Diagnostic
		Centre industry in Bangladesh. August 1988 we added ELISA Method, which was also the first unit in Bangladesh to use such sophisticated machine in Diagnostic services. Just a few months later we added world famous 
		Olympus Fibre Endoscopy Machine. From then it became a habit for us to add all the modern state of the art technologies in PDCL.
