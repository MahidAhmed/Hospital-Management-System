            <h3>Internal Quality Control</h3><br>
            <p>Providing results to the patients without confidence is not an option for Padma Diagnostic Centre Limited. To produce the highest quality report the importance of internal QC is indescribable. Everyday we run internal QC and it gives us the confidence on the report what we deliver to the hand of the patients is accurate. There are two types of internal QC. These are known as First party QC & Third party QC. According to ISO and WHO internal QC should be done daily with 3rd party QC. Currently at Padma Diagnostic Centre Limited we are using Third party internal QC from Randox Laboratories, United Kingdom.</p><br>

           <!--  <h3>External Quality Control</h3><br>
            <p>To maintain our quality we routinely perform Calibration test of all our instruments as well as external QC test in addition to internal QC. External quality assessment programs are accepted around the world as invaluable tools used by laboratories to assess the performance of their testing systems. Results are objectively compared to other laboratories using the same methodologies, instruments and reagents. When used in conjunction with daily quality control, these external programs can give laboratories added confidence in their patient test results.</p><br> -->
